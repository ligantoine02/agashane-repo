## Hello world

This is the first text someone writes in any programming language. I'll be writing it also for my blog.

### Rust 🥇😍

It's the language I'm learning these days.

```rust
    fn main() {
        println!("Hello world, Rust !");
    }
```

### Typescript (Javascript) 🥈👍

One of my daily languages using it with React, Remix, Gatsby and Astro ⭐
![A little cool placeholder](/src/assets/placeholder.jpg)

```typescript
console.log("Hello world, Typescript !");
```

### PHP 🥉🫶

With Laravel. Not too much, but I keep it in my heart because it's one of those I started with 🫶
